[histoire]

content_histoire = """It's in the early 70s, almost by chance, that the vocation of Nadine Guillaume went stronger. During holidays, she created for fun sweaters that soon gave her a notoriety in Paris and brought her to join Pierre Cardin broadcast studio, where she learnt the fundamentals that support her creativity.<br><br>


In 1978, her life intersected with that of the company LIL. Conquered by this modern mesh and guided by her intuition, she bought the company. Quickly, she upgraded it, modernizing workshops and assigning production to subcontractors.<br><br>


In 1986, she founded her own production unit in Amiens and deepened her knowledge of manufacturing mesh technology from the beginning of the production chain to the end, quality control.<br><br>


Attracted by these expertise and know-how in creation and research, many fashion designers have made their knitwear collections in LIL workshops. Their names : Madame Grès, Guy Paulin, Herve Leger, Karl Lagerfeld, Angelo Tarlazzi.<br><br>


Two personalities particularly marked Nadine in her fashion journey : Guy Paulin, in 1980, with whom she discovered a new universe full of color, combining modernity and elegance. Then Gabrielle Aghion, in 1993, founder of the house of Chloe, who worked with Nadine in her evolution, her thoughts on fashion and helped her to structure and develop her fashion house and collections.<br><br>


Since the spring-summer 2013 season, Nadine works with José Enrique Ona Selfa, graduated from the School of Visual Arts de la Cambre in Belgium and former Artistic Director of Loewe house (during 6 years), to manage the artistic direction of LIL. A perfect collaboration that combines know-how and modern style."""
